# How to customize your github profile!

## Intro:

I love it when websites, social medias, or platforms in general allow users to customize their pages or profiles. I like that personal touch. So when I started using github, I spent a some time doing that. However, some people have already asked me how I customized my profile, so to solve this I decided to create this guide.

In this guide I'll show you how to make your profile very similar to [mine](https://github.com/marcoshsq) if you want of course, and also provide some additional links where you can find icons, badges and templates customizations that you can do.

## The basics:

The first thing you should do is to fulfill your profile. You can add a profile picture, your name, and a short summary about yourself (your Bio). You can @mention other users and organizations to link to them.

After that, you can add some personal information, such as the company you're currently working for, country and state, your e-mail for contact, and your twitter. Remember, you're not obligated to do this, only if you wish.

## Designing your Profile

The first thig you should do is to create a repository with your user profile as a repository name, mine for example is [`marcoshsq`](https://github.com/marcoshsq).

Once you create this repository, github will say, it's a very special one. Let it public and add a `README.md`.

The `README.md` of this repository will be your profile on github, and everything you do in it will appear on your page.

## How to write on your README

As you noticed the extension of this file is `.md`, which indicates that it is written in markdown.

Here is a link with a quick tutorial on markdown. [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

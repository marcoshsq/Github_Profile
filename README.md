<h2>About:</h2>

This repository contains my studies of the Python language and some of its libraries. To guide my studies, I followed the Python Developer Roadmap, available in [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/python), until the Repo Hosting Services part.

This repository is divided into 8 folders, the first five are related to the Python 3 Programming specialization available on Coursera. To complement my studies, I acquired a list of exercises from the official Python Brazil website.

The sixth folder is about Data Structures and Algorithms, my goal is not to delve too deep into this subject here, as I intend to learn more in-depth later, but here are some concepts like: Binary Search, Linked Lists and Complexity, Binary Search Trees, Traversals and Recursion, Hash Tables and Python Dictionaries, Divide and Conquer, Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS & Shortest Paths), etc.

The seventh folder covers more advanced concepts like recursion, regular expressions, and Python specifics like iterators, generators, kwargs, and args. 

The last folder contains my projects and studies from the Tkinter library.

All courses and tutorials used for study will be at the end of this file, in the references section.

<h2>Contents:</h2>

### 01. [Python 3 Basics]()

This is the first [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-basics?specialization=python-3-programming) in the Python 3 Programming specialization.  This four-week course aims to introduce the fundamentals of the language and explores diverse concepts including conditional execution and iteration, such as control-of-flow structures, strings, and lists as data structures. Also, some Turtle library is presented for creating GUI applications and also some debugging techniques.

- [Week 01](): Values and Data Types, Operators and Operands, Function Calls, Type Conversion Functions, Variables, Statements, and Expressions,  Turtle Graphics, Importing Modules, Syntax, Runtime, and Semantic Errors, Debugging, etc.

- [Week 02](): Strings, Lists, Tuples, The Index Operator, The Slice Operator, Concatenation and Repetition, Count and Index, Split and Join, For Loop, The Accumulator Pattern, The Range Function, etc.

- [Week 03](): Boolean Expressions, Logical Operators, The in and not in Operators, Precedence of Operators, Conditional Execution, Unary Selection, Nested Conditionals, and Chained Conditionals, The Accumulator Pattern with Conditionals and Accumulating a Maximum Value, etc.

- [Week 04](): Mutability, List Element Deletion, Objects and References, Aliasing, Cloning Lists, Sequence Mutation, Methods on Lists and Strings Methods on Lists, Append vs. Concatenate, Non-Mutating Methods on Strings, String Format Method, Methods on Lists and Strings, Accumulating Lists and Strings, Making Reference Diagrams, Accumulator Pattern Strategies, etc.
